Get Internet Archive Books

An Activity for the One Laptop Per Child project which allows you to search through the Internet Archive collection
of free e-books and download the ones you want to your Journal in the format you want. Your Journal entry will 
be given a meaningful name. This is a much faster and easier way to get books than using the archive.org website
would be.
